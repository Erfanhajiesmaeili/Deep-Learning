# Deep Learning Projects

Welcome to my Deep Learning repository! This folder serves as a collection of various deep learning projects I've undertaken to explore and solidify my understanding of advanced neural network architectures and concepts.

## Purpose

The primary goal of these projects is educational. They represent practical implementations of core deep learning techniques learned through courses, tutorials, and self-study. Each project aims to showcase the application of one or more advanced models on different datasets, tackling problems ranging from computer vision to natural language processing.

## Models & Concepts Covered

The projects within this directory demonstrate the implementation and application of the following deep learning techniques:

### Foundational Networks
* **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) / Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP):** Building and training basic feedforward neural networks for regression and classification.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Designing and implementing CNNs for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks. This includes working with layers like Convolution, Pooling, and understanding concepts like filter maps and receptive fields.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Applying sequential models like Simple RNNs, LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRUs (Gated Recurrent Units) for time-series analysis, natural language processing, and other sequence-based tasks.

### Advanced Architectures & Techniques
* **Transfer Learning:** Utilizing pre-trained models (like VGG, ResNet, Inception) to solve new problems efficiently.
* **Autoencoders:** Implementing unsupervised networks for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and generative modeling.
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Exploring the fundamentals of generative modeling by building and training GANs.

## Structure

Typically, each sub-directory or Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file within this repository corresponds to a specific model architecture or a small project utilizing one or more of these techniques.

## Usage

Most projects are implemented in Python using common deep learning and data science libraries such as:

* **TensorFlow**
* **Keras**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**

To run the code, ensure you have Python and these libraries installed (preferably within a virtual environment). Specific requirements or setup instructions might be mentioned within individual project folders or notebooks if they differ.

Feel free to explore each directory to see how different deep learning models are built, trained, and evaluated on various challenging datasets.
